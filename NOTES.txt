Completed.
create a RGB colour detector.
generate a bunch of colour swatches to identify what colours represent the road.

To do List
Add More documentation.
create algorithm to identify errors. (Ideas being check two surrounding pixels (up/down/left/right) if two or more are road, then assume it is supposed to be road.
identify any bugs.
make program more efficient.
Create GUI
determine whether you want them to upload a screenshot of the map, or a web based GUI for it locked on zoom, but able to pan, with a search function for there suburb


Things to take into consideration. sacrificing some space for a speedup algorithmically.

potentially use open CV
